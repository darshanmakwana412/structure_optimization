# structure_optimization

Structure optimization via strain energy minimization. This project is currently work in progress

# To Do
- [*] Create a 3D implementation of the original proposal
- [] Plot strain energy vs iterations
- [] Benchmark with different frameworks and architectures
- [] Implement a learning rate scheduler for greater convergence towards the optimal structure and decrease the wobbliness
- [] Maybe include the stiffness matrix into force calculations for more realistic structures
- [] Taking inspiration from NEAT(NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) implement an evolutionary approach for creating and linking nodes to achieve a robust and optimal structure
## Installation
